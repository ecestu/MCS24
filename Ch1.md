### 4.4.1 FR-FCFS Memory Controller
    1. Row hit first (FR)
        - maximize performance by minimizing the number of row buffer conflicts
    2. Oldest request first (FCFS)
        - Considering fairness and simplicity
__SUMMARY__ : FR-FCFS memory controller is a simple and effective memory controller that can be used in many systems. It is easy to implement and provides good performance for a wide range of applications. However, it may not be the best choice for multi-threaded applications or applications with complex memory access patterns.
